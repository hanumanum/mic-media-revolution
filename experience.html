                    <blockquote>
                        The media became an important tool for the revolution.
                    </blockquote>
                    <div class="clear"></div>
                    <p>There were several preconditions for this. The first was the internet. Armenia has high-speed
                        and cheap internet with very broad coverage. A very large percentage of the population has
                        smartphones or tablets connected to the internet, and they are active on Facebook or YouTube.
                    </p>
                    <p>The other precondition was online streaming. Starting back in 2012, several websites in Armenia
                        had specialized in livestreaming and had improved their technical capacity to do this over the
                        years. Viewers watched this online live coverage of events. </p>
                    <p>Nikol Pashinyan’s live videos on Facebook were also a major source of information. People would
                        watch him to find out what he planned to do the following day. Pashinyan had only 40,000
                        followers at the end of March, but a month later this number had grown to more than half a
                        million. Not a single television channel could claim such high one-time viewership numbers.</p>
                    <blockquote>
                        The online channels were being “blamed” for keeping people away from the protests, with some
                        suggesting that viewers were preferring to follow the events from a distance instead of being
                        there. But this time, the livestreamed videos were compelling, the live feeds were magnetic.
                    </blockquote>
                    <div class="clear"></div>
                    <p>There was a universal protest, people felt compelled to come out into the streets and join their
                        brothers and sisters who were demonstrating in the streets.</p>
                    <p>It was also very important that people were not cut off from news updates once they stepped out
                        into the street. Technology allowed them to stay connected while they were outside. And they
                        started to broadcast live as well, becoming a media source for their own small numbers of
                        followers.</p>

                    <blockquote>This was a case where the saying “people are media” was very true indeed.</blockquote>
                    <div class="clear"></div>

                    <p>People used their phones to become broadcasters, documenters and reporters. These acts of civic
                        journalism were a great help to the news media, which would otherwise have had difficulties
                        finding out where Nikol Pashinyan was and what was going on, because the streets in the city
                        were closed.</p>
                    <blockquote>Television was defeated by online news media in this round.</blockquote>
                    <div class="clear"></div>
                    <p>The resources that the previous authorities had invested into television as a means for
                        disseminating news or propaganda ended up providing no returns. Because they were
                        unprepared to work in these conditions, both from a technical point of view and in terms of
                        lacking the required skills, traditional television ended up using images from the livestream
                        coverage of online channels. Their editorial teams were nevertheless working 24/7 during the
                        revolution. Their journalists, camera operators and photographers were walking 20-30 km a day
                        on average.</p>
                    <blockquote>On April 16, when the movement gathered critical mass, there was a fear that the
                        authorities would switch off the internet at any moment, thus severing the connection
                        between the leader of the revolution and the people.</blockquote>
                    <div class="clear"></div>
                    <p>But the authorities did not make that move. Perhaps it was a miscalculation on their part, or
                        perhaps they were afraid of infuriating the people and pushing them out into the streets. One of
                        the mobile operators had even added antennas at Republic Square. But there was still not
                        enough bandwidth. Telegram offered a solution, since it could work with low-speed connections
                        as well. A group of people created a channel called Infocom. Information began to spread
                        quickly on Telegram.</p>

                    <p>A creative and simple but ingenious solution, which allowed more people to be brought into play
                        and
                        had a major impact in a short period of time.</p>
                    <p>People had to be kept on the move. It was no coincidence that the leader of the Velvet
                        Revolution
                        was always walking. The slogan of “taking a step” already suggested that there was no point
                        sitting
                        and protesting, you had to actually do something. Something that was unusual, something that
                        brought change but was peaceful in nature. The message of peace became a core message of the
                        movement’s rhetoric. We will block the streets, but we will walk in peace, our hands held open.
                    </p>
                    <blockquote>
                        These simple rules of behavior clearly distinguished the revolutionaries from the others. It
                        was
                        thanks to these rules that huge masses of people transformed from crowds to organized groups
                        with a
                        clear statement – whoever does not behave like us is not one of us.

                    <p>Because aggressive words like “We’ll drive you out, kill you, destroy you,” were not allowed,
                        everyone expressed their anger by blowing on vuvuzelas. Its sharp buzzing was directed at the
                        ruling authorities.</p>
                    <p>The marches were horrifically huge, and the renowned Icelandic drum and Viking chant were a
                        great
                        support in regulating these groups, enthusing them and filling their opponents with fear.</p>

                    <blockquote>Two drumbeats and a clap – boom-boom-hooh! This rhythm matches the human heartbeat.
                        Everyone’s heart was beating in the same rhythm.</blockquote>
                    <div class="clear"></div>

                    <p>People were walking at the same pace, making the same moves. This created a massive effect of
                        unity,
                        power and confidence, a common energy field in which one could feel protected.</p>
                    <blockquote>The revolutionary song proclaimed the steps of the revolutionary program.</blockquote>
                    <div class="clear"></div>
                    <p>The rock song that consisted of lyrics penned by Nikol Pashinyan contained all the relevant
                        revolutionary instructions. The revolutionary messaging was simply repeated through this song.
                        It
                        started with rock, which is by itself a rebellion, a quake, a change. Then the song became a
                        repeating loop with techno rhythms, which was well suited to a rhythmic walk on the streets,
                        when
                        the lyrics are no longer important. Then there was the song by Tata, which was released in time
                        for
                        the celebrations. And finally, there was “dukhov” (literally, “with spirit”), which brought
                        together the broadest masses since it required no profound philosophy or intelligence.</p>

                        The word “dukhov” was brought into use so that people would not be afraid of the supposed power
                        of the authorities.
                    </blockquote>
                    <div class="clear"></div>
                    <p>The symbols of this movement were taken from everyday life. This includes the word “dukhov”. In
                        everyday life, when we want to inspire someone with the spirit of bravery, we tell them to just
                        be dukhov. Over many years, Serzh Sargsyan had convinced the people that they were powerless,
                        subordinate and that only he could act as a patron to the weak if he was so inclined. But
                        Pashinyan said that each person had their own power. People went from being powerless to
                        powerful, and the authorities lost any power that they had on those masses.</p>

                    <p>Serzh Sargsyan’s system did not know how to act against a strong people. Nikol Pashinyan had
                        raised people from the depths and told them, “Dukhov – go with spirit and fight!”.</p>
                    <blockquote>
                        “Dukhov” became a way for each person to speak out in their own name. The word “dukhov” had a
                        masculine nature, but it lost this character because even girls began to act “with spirit”.

                    <p>They grew disobedient to their parents. Parents would mostly prohibit their young daughters from
                        going out into the street at late hours, but they rejected that parental authority alongside
                        their rejection of Serzh. During those days of revolution, multiple watershed moments occurred.
                    </p>
                    <p>A political struggle was underway but it was using civic methods. It was a decentralized
                        struggle, where each participant was becoming a new source of power. In this way, the struggle
                        grew more open in nature and was not fully national – it accepted any kind of cultural
                        phenomenon, or innovative contribution. Each center made their own decision on what to do.</p>
                    <p>The creative nature of that power was enriched with a national character. Komitas was played on
                        the streets because he was a powerful cultural symbol. Carpets with national design were laid
                        out for the girls blocking Abovyan Street, symbolizing that we were fighting as one nation.
                        This meant that certain archetypes were also being put to work. Preparing a barbecue on
                        Republic Square was similarly an archaic idea. Sitting down on the grass and sharing the meal
                        was a sign of unity.</p>

                    <p>The students secured the participation of a large number of people and brought with them a new

                        The revolution became a national carnival.
                    </blockquote>
                    <div class="clear"></div>
                    <p>Why did the movement gain such momentum? Perhaps for the reason, among others, that our lives
                        are not very rich in festive celebrations. We have virtually no folk holidays that are
                        celebrated like carnivals. And in the same way that each group has their own way to express
                        their joy during a carnival, here too each group had their own approach to voicing their
                        protest.</p>

                    <p>It was this decentralization that turned the movement into a national carnival. We were able to
                        avoid any major clashes because, despite our level of modernization, we are not a very diverse
                        nation, and we are closely-knitted through our family connections and bloodlines. There were no
                        major clashes also because there was no external involvement.</p>

                    <blockquote>This was a revolution to solve internal issues.</blockquote>
                    <div class="clear"></div>

                    <p>The most revolutionary action was the occupation of an official square. The rallies of our
                        opposition parties would usually take place on Freedom Square, but Republic Square was an
                        official space from as far back as the Soviet times – it was a location that had seen many
                        military parades and official concerts. A very important, symbolic change occurred. The
                        revolutionaries occupied the official square, depriving it of the content it had previously
                        held and turning it into a national square in the true sense of the word.</p>
                    <p>Similar to Republic Square, other national symbols were also liberated, like the flag. The use
                        of national symbols meant that a symbolic change of power was taking place.</p>
